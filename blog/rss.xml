                <title>Ludum Dare 43: Post mortem of Panquetzalt</title>
                <description>A bit late as usual, here is what I learned, what worked and what didn&#039;t while
attempting for the first time the Ludum Dare. As it was my first LD, my only goal was
to submit something completed, even a very bad game.

planet.

                <title>Twigcs, it&#039;s the missing Phpcs for Twig!</title>
                <description>Lately I&#039;ve been working a lot on Twigcs, an open source project I initiated while working
at Allocin√© and kept working on ever after. So I felt like it&#039;s time to speak about it here.
