            <h2>November 8th, 2018 &nbsp; // Procjam 2018 : Post mortem of Causality</h2>
            <p>Better later than never, here is a feedback on my attempt at the the ProcJam 2018. The goal was to create
something that generates things. So I made a procedurally generated timeline that tells the story of a fictional
planet.</p>
<p>The main principles are to have a world with a state. Events occurs and alter the state, which in turn changes the
events that will occur. For instance, if the dice rolled that a sentient lifeform is pacifist then a war is less
likely to occur in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try it by yourself here : <a href="https://owlycode.itch.io/causality">https://owlycode.itch.io/causality</a></li>
<li>And you can grab the code here : <a href="https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality">https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly I had to drop some features/plans in order to finish in time. The first and biggest one being the ability to &quot;time travel&quot;.
I wanted the player to be able to change events outcome so they could try to rewrite a planet's history to what they wanted.
I am currently working on this for a post-jam update. Also the experience can be quite repetitive because of the small amount of
written events, this is also on the list of things to improve.</p>
<p>One other important sacrifice I made is documenting the project. The tool was designed to be reusable for anyone by just forking
the code and writing different events. I'm also working on a better readme on the project's github page. In the meantime if
you want to toy around with it, you can have a look at the main file <a href="https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality/blob/master/src/index.tsx">https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality/blob/master/src/index.tsx</a> to
see how events are loaded in the engine and <a href="https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality/tree/master/src/possibilities">https://github.com/OwlyCode/causality/tree/master/src/possibilities</a> to see how they
are designed.</p>
<p>Last but not least, here's the two main things I learned the hard way :</p>
<p><strong>Reduce the scope</strong></p>
<p>Doing one thing right is better than doing everything badly. With Causality my scope was too big :
to generate a full timeline I had to generate a planet, animals, civilizations and more. It caused me to work on a lot of different features
where I could have just focused on one (like the civilizations) to explore it more deeply. This is what caused my tool to feel
repetitive over time : too few events written per ages (world creation / animal evolution / civilizations).</p>
<p><strong>Text based games aren't easier to make</strong></p>
<p>Not having to deal with 2D or 3D maths doesn't mean it will be easier or quicker. Generating text also comes with a lot of
complexity, like plural or conjugation. No one notices that a pixel of your texture is glitching during 2 frames when the
character rotates but everyone will notice a typo or a missing space.</p>
<p>That's all folks ! If you have any question about the code or if you want to share your jam advices don't hesitate to leave a comment
or to ask me on twitter !</p>
