                <p>I'm currently working on Cozynergy's applications that help our teams and partners on their daily activities. Most of my work is done using <strong>PHP 7</strong> but from time to time
I do some <strong>NodeJs</strong>. I also do some devops with the help of <strong>docker</strong> and <strong>kubernetes</strong>.</p>

                <p>I worked on the <a href="http://www.allocine.fr/">Allociné</a> project at Webedia as an expert <strong>certified Symfony developer</strong>. It was a total rework of the project (see: <a href="http://business.lesechos.fr/directions-numeriques/technologie/cloud-computing/021575025646-comment-allocine-absorbe-le-pic-de-visites-liees-a-star-wars-205663.php">How Allociné handles the surge of traffic from Star Wars 7 (FR)</a>).</p>

                <p>I learnt to master <strong>Symfony2</strong> at the best place possible
for a Symfony developper : the creators of Symfony, where it all started ! My job mainly
consisted in taking part on projects that needed a <strong>reliable</strong>, <strong>enthusiastic</strong> and <strong>symfony-skilled</strong> developer.</p>
<p>I also sometime <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits?author=OwlyCode">contributed to Symfony's</a> code and documentation.</p>
<p>I gave a <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/OwlyCode/sf-pot2">french talk about Symfony and the twelve factors app</a> at the <strong>SfPot Lille</strong>  during the summer of 2015.</p>

                <p>I was the <strong>lead developer</strong> in the implementation of a <strong>highly
customizable web business management software</strong>, based on <strong>Symfony</strong>.</p>
<p>Beside my daily hard coding sessions, I often departed from being a standard
developper and got involved into the <strong>administration</strong> of the hosting platform,
<strong>conception</strong>, <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>workflow structuration</strong>.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>I used to implement <strong>search engines</strong>, crawling bots to parse websites and mechanisms
to display ads. I then was in <strong>charge of the conception and implementation</strong> of a
toolbar for Internet Explorer and Firefox with its associated application store.
At the same time, I took care of the conception, implementation and uptime of a
key application in the monetization strategy of the company. That is where I
learned all of my <strong>Symfony 1.4</strong> tricks.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>Free as a bird, I focused on the <strong>conception</strong> and developpment of applications and
websites on demand. I used to do a lot of <strong>ActionScript 3</strong> and <strong>Flex</strong> in association
with <strong>PHP</strong>. My best achievements were projects which I completed on a very tight
schedule, and as a subcontractor I quickly became specialized in these life and
death situations.</p>

                <p>That was my first job ! I developped websites and back offices from mockup to
final product in <strong>telework</strong>. I made my first steps in the <strong>PHP</strong> professional
development world. I also used to do some <strong>ActionScript 3</strong> and <strong>Flex</strong>.</p>
